# Cosmos SDK
## Overview
Probably the most popular framework to write your own blockchain (so called app chain). You just write your logic in go as a new cosmos SDK module.

## Resources
- [official cosmos sdk doc](https://docs.cosmos.network/main)
- [cosmos tutorial](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/)
- [interchain academy](https://interchainacademy.cosmos.network/)
- [ignite-cli](https://docs.ignite.com/guide/) one click cli to scaffold your cosmos sdk chain.
- [rollmint with cosmos SDK](https://docs.celestia.org/developers/wordle/) launch your cosmos sdk chain as a celestia rollup.

### Frontend tools
- [graz](https://graz.strange.love/) react hooks to help your frontend interact with cosmos chains
- [cosmology](https://cosmology.tech/) create-react-app like cli to create a frontend that setup the wallet adapter (e.g. you can create a frontend connect to osmosis using keplr, cosmostation, leap, etc).
	- [shuttle](https://shuttle.delphilabs.io/) is a similar tool to scaffold frontend with wallet, targeting terra for now.

### Data analysis tools
- [numia](https://numia.xyz/) providing indexed cosmos data for you to query.
